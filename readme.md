# CyberTermX Theme (Jekyll)

A terminal-themed, hacker-aesthetic Jekyll portfolio designed specifically for cybersecurity professionals, exploit developers, and bug bounty hunters. 

This theme is **100% dynamic**. You do not need to touch any HTML to update your portfolio. Everything is managed through simple YAML configuration files.

## Features
- **Hacker Aesthetic:** Matrix background, CRT scanlines, and neon-terminal UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- **Fully Configurable:** Update your identity, skills, projects, and CVEs strictly through `_config.yml` and the `_data/` directory.
- **Interactive Terminal:** A working web-based shell that visitors can use to run commands (`whoami`, `ls`, `neofetch`, `crack`, `hack`, etc.).
- **Dynamic RSS Integration:** Automatically pulls your latest blog posts from your WordPress site via the rss2json API.
- **Easter Eggs:** Hidden commands, Konami code integration, and cinematic "Hollywood hacking" sequences.
- **Mobile Responsive:** Looks great on desktop monitors and mobile devices.
